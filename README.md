# wtf-bf

This is a small side project written in [Brainfuck](https://brainfuck.org/) – a
minimalist, esoteric programming language made up of just eight commands. While
Brainfuck is Turing-complete, it's mostly used for puzzles, experimentation, and
brain-twisting fun rather than practical applications.

I used it here purely for the challenge and enjoyment – as a creative exercise
to output the sentence that had been a brainfuck for me for years.

## Optimisation

Purely for the challenge, I've been trying to optimise bf programs to use as few commands as possible.  
By using 5 cells and setting them to 81 35 45 99 121, my program moves between the cells updating them and outputting them to save commands (955 -> 397).
